## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
Welcome on my GitHub,
i'm Francesco, an Italian jr full-stack web-dev, i've always been interested in techs, sciences and web.
actually i've ignored my inclinations for quite a bit (7 years) and recently some things aligned
and this gave me the possibility to start an online Master Bootcamp with Boolean and this taught me the necessary abilities to start to work in this field.
Here you can find my projects from the Boolean's bootcamp practical exercises and also projects to learn new languages.
Thanks to the collaboration between Boolean and Experis, on 19/12 i've successfully completed a Java full-time bootcamp of 6 weeks, in which i learned the Java fundamentals for the web and the framework Spring.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project using Vue and Laravel, for a flight booking webapp
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a job that could help me to grow professionally and improve my knowledge and abilities in development
