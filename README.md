## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
Welcome on my GitHub,
i'm Francesco, an Italian jr web-dev, i've always been interested in techs, sciences and web
actually i've ignored my inclinations for quite a bit (7 years) and recently some things aligned
and this gave me the possibility to start an online Master Bootcamp with Boolean and this taught me the necessary abilities to start to work in this field.
Here you can find my projects from the Boolean's bootcamp practical exercises and i hope ASAP my own projects
